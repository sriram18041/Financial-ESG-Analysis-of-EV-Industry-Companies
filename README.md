# Financial-ESG-Analysis-of-EV-Industry-Companies

This project analyzes the financial health and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) performance of four leading EV companies—Tesla, BYD, NIO, and Lucid—using Python. We extracted financial data (2020–2024) from Yahoo Finance, calculated key ratios (ROE, ROA, liquidity metrics), forecasted trends (2025–2026) via linear regression, and evaluated ESG risks to provide actionable insights for investors.
